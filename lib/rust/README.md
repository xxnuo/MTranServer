# Rust version (community version)

Performance improvement is not significant, only works in x86_64 Linux and some APIs are not compatible with the original version, recommend to use [golang version](../../v3/README.md) instead.

Rust server source code is in [LinguaSpark/server](https://github.com/LinguaSpark/server)
